# 🧠 Endometriosis AI – Early Detection Support Tool

### 💡 Overview
**Endometriosis AI** is an AI-assisted application designed to support early detection and awareness of endometriosis through non-invasive symptom analysis and patient history inputs.  
This project demonstrates how machine learning and healthcare technology can work together to provide diagnostic assistance and patient empowerment.

The app is built using **Streamlit** for interactivity and visualization, and a **TensorFlow-based stub model** for predictive simulation (educational demo only).
